# 👋 Hi, I’m <Your Name>

I’m a **system programmer and M.Sc. student** passionate about understanding how **hardware meets software**.  
I build tools and write about **concurrency**, **compilers**, **memory models**, and **performance engineering**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design and implement **threading primitives** in **C and Assembly** — including CAS, TAS, and semaphores.  
- Build small **operating systems** to explore **data and instruction race conditions**.  
- Experiment with **shadow memory management** and **memory instrumentation** (inspired by Valgrind).  
- Write technical blogs like *“Why People Assume Reads Are Not Overhead?”* to share low-level performance insights.

---

## 🔬 Interests
- Operating Systems  
- Compilers and Runtimes  
- CPU Architecture and Memory Models  
- Concurrency and Synchronization  
- Performance Profiling Tools
